# Side Step - Character Rebrand Analysis

## Current Concept: "Running Shoe"

**The Problem:** The player character is literally a shoe. While unique, this creates several challenges:

| Issue | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| **No face/personality** | Hard to create emotional connection |
| **Limited animation potential** | Shoes don't have expressive features |
| **Difficult to market** | "Play as a shoe" isn't compelling |
| **Art asset complexity** | Need 4 unique shoe designs that read well at small sizes |
| **Upgrade confusion** | "Buy better shoes" when you ARE a shoe is conceptually weird |

---

## Rebrand Options

### Option 1: 🏃 **RUNNER KID/PERSON** (Recommended)
*Keep the shoe upgrade mechanic, but attach it to a character*

**Concept:** A young runner/athlete who upgrades their footwear

**Progression:**
| Level | Character State | Ability |
|-------|-----------------|---------|
| Start | Barefoot kid | Basic jump |
| Tier 2 | Kid + Flip Flops | Faster |
| Tier 3 | Kid + Sneakers | + Dash |
| Tier 4 | Kid + Winged Shoes | + Double Jump |

**Pros:**
- ✅ Keeps your existing shoe upgrade system intact
- ✅ Character has a face = personality/marketing potential
- ✅ Easy to find assets (Kenney has character sprites)
- ✅ Natural fit: person running through worlds makes sense
- ✅ Can add costumes/skins as additional monetization

**Cons:**
- ❌ Less unique than "sentient shoe" concept
- ❌ Similar to Subway Surfers, Temple Run characters

**Name Ideas:** 
- "Side Step" (keep it!)
- "Dash Kid"
- "Run!"

---

### Option 2: 🐾 **ANIMAL RUNNER**
*A cute animal character with costume/gear upgrades*

**Concept:** A small animal (fox, cat, rabbit, etc.) running through environments

**Progression:**
| Level | Character State | Ability |
|-------|-----------------|---------|
| Start | Basic animal | Basic jump |

**Pros:**

### Option 3: 🤖 **ROBOT/MECH**
*A small robot that upgrades its parts*

**Pros:**

| Tier 4 | Blob + wings | + Double Jump |

**Popular Examples:**

- Geometry Dash (cube with face)

**Pros:**
- ✅ VERY easy to animate (squash & stretch)
- ✅ Simple silhouette reads well on mobile
- ✅ Cute factor

- ✅ Color variants = easy skins

**Cons:**
- ❌ Less distinct personality
- ❌ "Generic indie game" feel

**Name Ideas:**

### Option 5: 👟✨ **MAGICAL SHOE** (Keep Current, Enhance)
*The shoe IS the character, but with personality*

**Concept:** Keep the shoe, but give it a face and personality

**Enhancements:**
- Add googly eyes to the shoe

**Pros:**
- ✅ Keeps your unique concept

- ✅ "Brave Little Toaster" vibes (objects with personality)
- ✅ Stands out from competition
- ✅ Meme potential ("I'm literally a shoe")

**Cons:**
- ❌ Still harder to market than traditional characters

**Name Ideas:**
- "Side Step" (keep it!)
- "Sole Survivor"
- "Lace Up!"

## 🏆 TOP RECOMMENDATION: Runner Kid

**Why this works best:**

1. **Preserves your game design** - The shoe upgrade system becomes "kid buys better shoes" which is intuitive

2. **Asset availability** - Kenney's Platformer Pack Redux has ready-to-use character sprites with animations

3. **Marketing appeal** - "Help [Name] run through 5 worlds!" is more compelling than "Play as a shoe"

4. **Customization potential** - Add character skins, outfits, hair styles as additional unlockables

5. **Emotional connection** - Players root for characters with faces

**Suggested Implementation:**

```
Character: "Dash" (or player-named)
- A young runner/skater kid
- Gender-neutral or selectable
- Expressive animations (happy when collecting coins, scared of obstacles)

Progression:
- Barefoot → Shows determination, "starting from nothing"
- Flip Flops → Beach vibes, casual
- Sneakers → Getting serious, athlete mode
- Winged Shoes → Mythical hero moment

Skins (future monetization):
- Different hair colors
- Outfit styles (sporty, casual, punk, etc.)
- Seasonal costumes (holiday themed)
```

## Code Impact Assessment

If you choose **Runner Kid**, here's what changes:

| Component | Change Required |
|-----------|-----------------|
| `player.gd` | Replace shoe polygon with AnimatedSprite2D |
| `game_manager.gd` | Rename `SHOES` to `GEAR` or keep as-is (shoes are still upgrades) |
| Shop UI | Update icons, keep shoe purchasing logic |
| Main Menu | Update character display |
| Tutorial | Update "shoe" references to "gear" |

**Estimated effort:** 2-4 hours of code changes + new sprite assets

---

## Quick Comparison with Popular Runners

| Game | Character | Why It Works |
|------|-----------|--------------|
| Subway Surfers | Teen with skateboard | Relatable, rebellious, customizable |
| Temple Run | Explorer | Adventure feel, heroic |
| Jetpack Joyride | Barry with jetpack | Funny everyman, expressive |
| Sonic Dash | Sonic | Iconic, fast = brand identity |
| Crossy Road | Chicken (+ 100s) | Simple, collectible, cute |
| Alto's Odyssey | Snowboarder | Peaceful, artistic |

**Common thread:** All have recognizable characters with faces that players connect with.

## Next Steps

1. **Decide on character direction** (recommend: Runner Kid)
2. **Download Kenney Platformer Pack Redux** for character sprites
3. **Update player.gd** to use sprite-based character
