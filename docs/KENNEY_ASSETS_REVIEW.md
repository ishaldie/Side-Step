# Kenney Assets Review for Side Step

## Overview

The GitHub repository you linked (**Starter-Kit-Basic-Scene**) is a **3D** starter kit for Godot with the Mini Arena pack. This is **NOT useful for Side Step** since our game is 2D.

However, Kenney.nl has excellent **2D assets** that would be perfect for Side Step. All assets are **CC0 licensed** (public domain - free for commercial use, no attribution required).

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Download Free Packs (Immediate)
1. Platformer Pack Redux (characters, coins, obstacles)
2. UI Pack (menus, buttons)
3. Game Icons (stars, settings)

### Step 2: Create Asset Folder Structure
```
res://assets/
├── kenney/
│   ├── platformer-pack-redux/
│   ├── ui-pack/
│   └── game-icons/
├── sprites/
│   ├── player/
│   ├── obstacles/
│   └── coins/
└── ui/
```

### Step 3: Replace Procedural Graphics
1. Player: Replace Polygon2D with Sprite2D using character sprites
2. Obstacles: Map each type to appropriate Kenney sprite
3. Coins: Use gold coin sprite with rotation animation
4. UI: Apply UI Pack theme to all buttons/panels

### Step 4: Add Missing Custom Assets
Some Side Step-specific items may need custom sprites:
- Specific shoe designs (4 types)
- World-specific obstacles (backpack, hydrant, etc.)
- Finish flag

## Cost Summary

| Option | Cost | What You Get |
|--------|------|--------------|
| Free Individual Packs | $0 | Most of what you need |
| All-in-1 Bundle | $19.95 | Everything + future updates |
| Custom Art (gaps only) | $50-200 | Unique shoe designs, special obstacles |

**Recommended:** Download free packs first, buy All-in-1 if you need more variety.

## Conclusion

The **Starter-Kit-Basic-Scene** you linked is 3D and not useful for Side Step.

**Instead, download these free Kenney 2D packs:**

2. **UI Pack** - Complete menu overhaul
3. **Game Icons** - Stars, settings, achievements

These three packs alone would dramatically improve Side Step's visual quality at **zero cost**.

- Multiple art styles to choose from
- Audio assets included
- Future updates free
